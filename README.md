# Spy-Plane-Project

In 2016 BuzzFeed published an article reporting on flights of spy planes from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). BuzzFeed determined that it should be possible to train a ML algorithm to find government spy planes based on flight patterns that resemble those operated by the FBI and DHS. Based off of flight pattern data from  Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/spy-plane-finder?select=faa_registration.csv), I will implement a Machine Learning Algorithm that will try to classify a plane as "surveil"(spy surveilence plane) or "other". 

After I recieved the predictions for each plane I was curious to find out the top businesses, cities, and states that had the highest probabilities of having spy planes. Their are provided visualizations that help to give insight to those questions.
