# Spy-Plane-Project

In 2016 BuzzFeed published an article reporting on flights of spy planes from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). BuzzFeed determined that it should be possible to train a ML algorithm to find government spy planes based on flight patterns that resemble those operated by the FBI and DHS.

With data gathered from Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/spy-plane-finder?select=faa_registration.csv), I implemented a Machine Learning Algorithm that classifies a plane as "surveil"(spy surveilence plane) or "other" based on a planes features and flight pattern. 

After I recieved the predictions for each plane I was curious to find out the top businesses, cities, and states that had the highest probabilities of having spy planes; visuals are given to help answer those questions.
